## Final Project ##
--------------------
Machine learning model to determine the genre of a hypothetical song based from UI song characteristics
--------------------


# Overview #
Take a dataset of songs which contains characteristics of each song. Use these
to generate a model which predicts genre.

Use this model to take inputs (song characteristics) and predict what genre this
hypothetical (or real) song is likely to be.

--BONUS--
1. If I get time build a web interface for users to input song characteristics and returns
the predicted song genre.
2. The above, but return a list of Artists whose songs most likely resemble the input
characteristics
